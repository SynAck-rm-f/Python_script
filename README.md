Black Hat Python – Learning & Lab Exercises

This repository contains Python scripts developed while studying the book
"Black Hat Python" (Justin Seitz & Tim Arnold).

The purpose of this repository is educational and lab-based learning.
All scripts were implemented to understand offensive security concepts,
network programming, and how common attack techniques work at a technical level.

Covered topics include:
- TCP / UDP client-server communication
- Packet sniffing and protocol analysis
- Network scanners
- Proxying and traffic interception
- SSH client/server interactions
- Basic post-exploitation concepts in controlled environments

The scripts are executed exclusively in local or isolated lab environments
(VMs, intentionally vulnerable systems, and test networks).
